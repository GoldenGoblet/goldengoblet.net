##### Scoring Notes

- Where appropriate, I am using the result of each player's first match to determine if they receive a point for each day.
- This is consistent with how they decided to score the previous Clubhouse Games week.
- Currently the only exceptions are Yacht Dice and Bowling.
- **1.** Yacht Dice's score is independent of the opposing player's result.
- **2.** Bowling is single player only.
